# Project-Euler

This is just my progress in solving Project Euler questions using different programming languages.

If you don't know Project Euler is a website that host 800+ math questions to solve using your computer language of your choice.

While questions can be solved using bruteforce, it is encouraged to solve them under 1 minute. Here is my collection of solutions 
for the questions as I am currently working towards them. I have initially worked using Swift but have switched to using
Python 3. 

Questions ------------------------------------------------

001 - Multiples of 3 or 5 (0.0001 sec)

002 - Even Fibonacci Numbers (0.00004 sec)
