# Project-Euler

This is just my progress in solving Project Euler questions using different programming languages.

If you don't know Project Euler is a website that host 800+ math questions to solve using your computer language of your
choice.

While questions can be solved using bruteforce, it is encouraged to solve them under 1 minute. Here is my collection of
solutions
for the questions as I am currently working towards them. I have initially worked using Swift but have switched to using
Python 3.
